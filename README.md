# sodium-java

An update of the sodium-java code for jdk16, including:
  1. some newer java idioms (var, switch, etc.)
  2. replace use of 'synchronized' with juc Lock's
  3. junit5 for tests
  
I'll try to port the other examples from the [FRP book](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-reactive-programming) as well.
